RinProd.com is not your standard R website or blog. This website isn't really even aimed at R users (there are lots of better sites for that audience) but rather the IT and Ops professionals tasked with building and maintaining R based infrastructure.

The goal of the project is to provide that audience with the information they need to expand the analytics capability that they're able to offer for their businesses.

If you find a problem with this site, or think that something is missing, let us know on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rinprod/rinprod.com/issues) for the project.
