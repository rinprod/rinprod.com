Learn about running R in production.

!!! warning "Important note"

    This site is an early stage work in progress, with work happening in public.

    Content is currently extremeley sparse, but if there's something you'd like to know about, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/rinprod/rinprod.com/issues).


If you're an **R user** looking for more information on writing R for production use cases, this site isn't really about that, so check the [resources for writing production R](writing-production-r.md) page instead.
Having said that, if you're interested in writing code for certain use-cases, such as CI/CD or HPC, have a look around, there may be something here you find useful.


## Understanding R and its ecosystem

The best place to start your journey towards understanding the world of R is the [Field Guide to the R Ecosystem](https://fg2re.sellorm.com).
It's a concise, non-technical introduction to the language and supporting software.
The guide presumes no previous knowledge of R or any other programming language and is aimed primarily at managers and IT professionals approaching the language for the first time.

If you're just starting to learn about R, read the field guide first, then come back here for a deeper dive.
