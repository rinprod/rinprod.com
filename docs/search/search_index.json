Often, this is attributed to unhelpful IT departments, unwilling to adopt new approaches or methods. Whilst this perception is common, the reality is often that IT departments are not familiar with R and rarely have the bandwidth (or budget) to learn more about it.</p> <p>In the slides that follow, we'll take a look at the two main approaches that people use to successfully get R in production and begin deliver the benefits of R to the wider business.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-talk-that-started-it-all/#slide-2-3","title":"Slide 2 &amp; 3","text":"<p>There's no magic formula to running any language in production and R is no different.

Acknowledging this is the key to running any language in production.

The basic goal is to impress a decision maker higher up in the organisation who can exert downward pressure on the business in general and the IT team in particular. If you can impress this person enough they'll push through your project to allow you to run R in production.</p> <p>The main issue with this approach is that it's quite confrontational and is unlikely to make you any friends. That said, there are many examples of it working well and enabling the business to take this important step.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-talk-that-started-it-all/#slide-15-16","title":"Slide 15 &amp; 16","text":"<p>The other option is the right hand path.</p> <p>This approach directly addresses the elephant in the room, getting R past your IT team and into production.</p> <p>The first thing we need to do here is clear up this IT-team-as-the-enemy trope. In the vast majority of large organisations the IT team exists purely to enact the technical will of the business and the way it works is an expression of that will. In general IT teams are intentionally slow to change and risk-averse. As the gatekeepers of an organisation's infrastructure the IT team -- or ops, or devops or whatever they're called in your business -- have the ultimate responsibility for the security of the business's information. As a consequence they have a natural tendency towards conservatism when it comes to the infrastructure that they're responsible for.</p> <p>This responsibility often puts them at odds with the goals of a data scientist, which is generally to access and leverage data. Given these conflicting priorities it is unsurprising that there is sometimes friction between these groups.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-talk-that-started-it-all/#slide-17","title":"Slide 17","text":"<p>Data science and software engineering aren't the same thing, though there is significant overlap.</p> <p>In well run data science teams I don't usually expect to see much more than code reviews and methodological reviews - we must be sure the code does what we think it does and that the statistical methodologies used are appropriate for the task at hand.</p> <p>Enterprise scale software engineering teams however, generally have many more hoops to jump through in their work and it is often siloed into very narrow bands to facilitate hand-offs between each activity. For example, a developer may be able to run automated and unit tests themselves but their code will often go to a specific test team for further testing, such as User Acceptance Testing or UAT, before passing on to the next stage in the release process. This release process tends towards the lengthy and extremely rigourous. In some organisations the length of time it will take to release even a simple application to their production environment is so long that even the thought of bringing in anything new can be extremely problematic.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-talk-that-started-it-all/#slide-18","title":"Slide 18","text":"<p>These are just a few of the things you might need to get your head around when working to get R into a production setting.</p> <p>To be clear, I'm not suggesting that all data scientists need to learn this stuff. For many there will be no need and for many others no interest - and that's absolutely fine - what we're talking about here is building a deeper understand of a different area of the business that you might have to work with.
