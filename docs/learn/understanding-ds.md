# Understanding Data Science

From the outside, the work of a data scientist can appear to be very similar to software development.
A data scientist will write code, use an IDE and store their code in version control.
However, it's important to recognise the differences as they drive much of the design and associated processes required for writing R in production environments.

R users write software to analyse data, but the primary output of data science is insight and knowledge.
This is in contrast to software development, where the primary output is software.

A software developer must ensure that the software they write operates as intended.
It must perform its intended funtion time and again with an appropriate user experience and performance characteristics to the task at hand.

Conversely, a data scientist  might only run the software they write once, in order to produce the required insight.
What's most important here is ensuring the methodological correctness and statistical rigor of the insight they produce and as a result, the code that is written is a secondary concern.

This might also mean the testing is limited, or perhaps omitted altogether, and might be very different to the types of testing you're accustomed to in the software testing sphere.
Testing might focus exclusively on the methodologies used and ensuring they've been correctly implemented, rather than in attempting to find bugs, edge cases, or deviations from requirements.
In fact there might neot even be any requirements.

Of course this there can be substantial overlap, especially where data scientists might get involved in extension package development or writing apps to present the insight they have produced for consumption by others.

Think of data science as you might any other science.
It's inherently exploratory in nature as data is probed and examined before a scientist starts to use the tools available to them to tease new knowledge from the data that is their subject matter.
