Hopefully you've realised by this point that this site isn't so much about R as it is the R ecosystem and infrastructure around R. So it's not the best place for information on writing production R. If that's what you're interested in though, the broader R community has you covered.

Here are some links to the best resources for writing better R code:

# Absolute beginners

* [Field Guide to the R Ecosystem](https://fg2re.sellorm.com): a short guide for those new to the R ecosystem and targeted specifically at Ops teams and managers.


# Starting out

* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's "[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)" is a very popular text for new users. It's so popular in fact that it's spawned it's own [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) of learners and mentors helping newcomers with the language and working on problems together.


# Version Control

* Jenny Bryan and team's "[Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)" is a fantastic starting point for using git (and specifically GitHub.com) for version control.


# More advanced users

* The "[Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)" book, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace is an excellent resource for squeezing maximum performance from the language.
* Hadley Wickham's "[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)", is hugely well regarded exploration of some more advanced topics.


# Shiny

* [Shiny in production](https://kellobri.github.io/shiny-prod-book/) (Kelly O'Briant and Sean Lopp): a supplement to the 'Shiny in Production' 2 day workshop delivered at RStudio::conf 2019.
