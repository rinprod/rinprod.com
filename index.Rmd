# About

RinProd.com is not your standard R website or blog. This website isn't really even aimed at R users (there are lots of better sites for that audience) but rather the IT and Ops professionals tasked with building and maintaining R based infrastructure.

The goal of the project is to provide that audience with the information they need to expand the analytics capability that they're able to offer for their businesses.

If you find a problem with this site, or think that something is missing, let us know on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rinprod/rinprod.com/issues) for the project.

# Guides

If you're an **R user** looking for more information on writing R for production use cases, this site isn't really about that, so check the [resources for writing production R](/writing-production-r/) page instead.

## Understanding R and it's ecosystem

The best place to start your journey towards understanding the world of R is the [Field Guide to the R Ecosystem](https://fg2re.sellorm.com). It's a concise, non-technical introduction to the language and supporting software. The guide presumes no previous knowledge of R or any other programming language and is aimed primarily at managers and IT professionals approaching the language for the first time.

# Best practices for R developers

Not code stuff, but more about the management of the overall environment.

eg "how do we handle secrets?"

* Don't hard code them in your scripts
* Use an alternate strategy, eg config, env vars etc.


## Secrets

## Database connections

What makes this for “data science”?

Who is this book for?

Why Linux?

Which Linux? How to choose.

Accessing Linux - client side set up

Standing up a server - local/cloud, real/virtual

Logging in and looking around

Files, directories, users/groups, ownership, editing (crash course in vim), permissions, shell scripts, curl 

Users, who am I, got root

Installing packages - repositories, differences between linuxes, updating packages

Root and sudo

Install R and Python - when to use OS supplied software and when not to.

Env vars, paths, ssh keys, from

Authentication - local, ad joined

Multi user management

Disk space

Remote file systems
